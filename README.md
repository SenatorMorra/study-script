**`Study Script`** - it is a programming language designed to teach programming. The main aspect of the study is focused on the fundamental processes occurring in a computer and with memory, when executing commands in high-level programming languages.

It is suitable for both elementary school children to learn the basics of programming, and for any adult who wants to learn programming from scratch or a theoretical knowledge base about internal processes in compilers / interpreters or low-level programming languages without all the standard functions familiar to us.

# Language features

### Advantages:
- an open source project
- simulation of low-level processes by high-level teams
- the language is very easy to learn
- has a built-in stopwatch for program execution, as well as an indicator of the garbage left in memory
- self-invention and understanding of fundamental functions and operators

### Disadvantages:
- not intended for the development of real projects
- the syntax does not match the syntax of popular programming languages
- the built-in functionality of the language is severely limited

### Features:
- written in `Node.js `
- files with code written in `Study Script` have the file extension `.ss`

# Project roadmap

The planned commercial development of the project and the functional development of the language.

## 2025 Q1-Q2:

- [ ] adding loops
- [ ] adding comments
- [ ] adding character conversion to character code
- [ ] adding a variable value change
- [ ] development of full-fledged documentation
- [ ] creating examples of simulating fundamental functions and operators
- [ ] creating a library of basic programming tasks
- [ ] adding syntax highlighting extension to `VSCode`, `SublimeText`
- [ ]  publishing the compiler for public use
- [ ] creating an educational platform using `Study Script`
