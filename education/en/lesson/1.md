# First prorgam

`Study Script` is a programming language for education, developed for study system programming from zero. It doesn't provide all functionality for system programming, but may help with practice, simple examples and realization.

In case of system programming all our moves will be downgraded a lot, for example we also need to start process of program ourself and finish ourself too.

For it we uses `start` and `finish` commands, so our programm will be like:

```
start

...
code
...

finish
```

Just in case, each command must be in different lines.

First of all we have to know, how to print information, we have command `log` for it with syntax:
`log <data_type> <data_expression>`

and if I wanna write text I uses `log string <data...>` and for numbers - `log number <data...>`

so our first programm will be

```
start

log string "Hello world!"

finish
```

nice, here we go!

Also, just in case, we writes text between `"`.

You also may be interested how our programm works downgraded:
1. `start` - OS kernel creates system proccess with PID
2. process starts, temprorary data stores in RAM, all calculations in CPU
3. `log`, CPU sends data to GPU
4. GPU sends data to Monitor
5. Monitor prints our data
6. `finish` - OS kernel kill process with PID

That's simple scheme of our programm works, this template also will be actual for any program, but `3.` will be `3.1. CPU calculations`, `3.2. CPU sends data to GPU`
